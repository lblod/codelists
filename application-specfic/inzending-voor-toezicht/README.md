# Context
For the application "inzending-voor-toezicht/medlingsplicht", we want to keep track of the conceptschemes used.

Some new conceptschemes have been defined to correspond with fields in the forms related to the application (mainly select-boxes).
Other conceptschemes are literally reused from the existing ones. We want to keep track of what is required, hence the link.
